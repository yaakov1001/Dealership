# Dealership
I would like to increase sales at our car dealership. What we need is to have a clear picture of which cars are currently selling best. The first step is to set up a database from which we can pull reports.

## Spec
The full spec is included in the repo in the file called business scenario.sql.

## Deliverables
The 3 files listed below are required to implement the requirements for this repo. The info for each one is in the spec.
1. table.sql (create database and table)
2. sample data.sql
3. reports.sql

## SQL Requirements
- primary key
- properly named columns
- proper data types
- not null as apporpriate
- constraints
- files should be able to run repeatedly so include drop and use statements
